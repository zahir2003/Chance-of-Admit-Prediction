## 📊 Workflow Overview

1. **Data Loading & Inspection**
   - Load the dataset and explore its structure
   - Check for missing values and data types

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Remove unnecessary columns
   - Handle outliers using visualization and capping techniques
   - Feature selection and engineering

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize distributions, boxplots, and QQ plots for numeric features
   - Identify and treat outliers

4. **Model Building**
   - Split data into training and testing sets
   - Train Linear Regression and Ridge Regression models
   - Evaluate models using R² Score and Mean Squared Error
   - Perform cross-validation for robust evaluation

5. **Results & Insights**
   - Compare model performances
   - Interpret results and discuss findings

## 🛠️ Key Code Snippets

```python
# Data Loading
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
df = pd.read_csv("Admission_Predict_Ver1.1.csv")

# Data Visualization
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
sns.boxplot(df['GRE Score'])

# Model Training
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluation
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score
print("MSE:", mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred))
print("R2 Score:", r2_score(y_test, y_pred))
```
